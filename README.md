## Overview

### Description
A currency conversion app that gives the user the option to input their amount of money that they wish to convert, a drop down to choose their currency type, and then a list of currency options that they can scroll or search for to convert their currency to. The market rate is updated real-time through an API every time the user is connected to the internet and stored in a database.

### App Evaluation
- **Category**: Finance/Utility
- **Mobile**: Ease of use. Users can access currency market values at the push of a button. This app will emphasize a push to click and real time user experience. 
- **Story**: This is useful for travellers. Currency values don't fluctuate rapidly. However, the exchange rates can be punishing towards the user. Users are often at the mercy of the trader. Knowing this information can help the user gain an advantage. 
- **Market**: Any tourist in need of quick currency exchanges would find this app useful. Any immigrant wishing to send money to another country to help family members would also find this app useful.
- **Habit**: Tourists would this app at least once every few days.
- **Scope**: There are free currency converter API's that we can access. The biggest difficulty should be finding one with an easy to parse JSON. A stripped down version will maintain the real time currency conversion but may have a limited scope of world currencies available.
